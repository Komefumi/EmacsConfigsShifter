# Emacs Config Shifter

This project exhausted me despite how short it is.

I realized that there's a lot I need to learn about structuring my code, and about Golang as well.

I'll add more into the functionality to make it safer to use. Less likely to accidentally destroy my **precious** Emacs config. Note, I'm being slightly sarcastic.

As a side note, I'll use VSCode more.

A Golang util that lets me shift the emacs configurations that I have, conveniently. You can browse through the source code, it should be straightforward. You can feel free to use this project and code as you see fit
